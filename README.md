# Code of Conduct

The organizers of Ottawa ReactJS are dedicated to providing a inclusive, respectful, harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Meetup, including talks. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying in any form. This does not only extend to members to local Ottawa ReactJS communities, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger Ottawa ReactJS community of users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.

## Anti-harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion

* Sexual images in public spaces

* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following

* Harassing photography or recording

* Sustained disruption of talks or other events

* Inappropriate physical contact

* Unwelcome sexual attention

* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any event, or expulsion from mailing lists, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from Ottawa ReactJS Meetup group membership.
*We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues, event-related social activities as well as social media.*

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

### Anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous report [here](https://goo.gl/forms/VQHTYbW5P75iOOte2). We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.


### Personal Report  

You can make a personal report by:

    Emailing us: ottawareactjs@gmail.com

When taking a personal report, the organizers will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

## Photo Policy

Please ask before taking photographs of attendees, speakers or staff.

## Inclusive Language

In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we strongly believe it's important to pay attention to harmful language patterns.

*Ableism*

Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of ableist language, devaluating people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please read this guide.

*Sexism*

Using gendered terms like "dude" or "guys" to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.
